**pyrastitcher** is a Python 2 and 3 module that provides a Python interface to the amazing [Terastitcher](https://github.com/abria/TeraStitcher) package. **pyrastitcher** does not install Terastitcher, nor does it make any assumptions about your installation. `terastitcher` should be on your system path.

## Installation



Generally, installation failures can be fixed by running the same line again, which, yeah, that's super janky, whatever. If that still fails, try cloning the repository from https://github.com/neurodata/ndio and running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

If you're still having no luck, try checking out the `travis.yml` file in the main directory of the repository — these are the lines required to get ndio up and running on a totally blank Ubuntu 14.04 machine.
