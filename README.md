# pyrastitcher

**pyrastitcher** is a Python 2 and 3 module that provides a Python interface to the amazing [Terastitcher](https://github.com/abria/TeraStitcher) package. **pyrastitcher** does not install Terastitcher, nor does it make any assumptions about your installation. `terastitcher` should be on your system path, but doesn't have to be â€” see the documentation (which, of course, doesn't exist yet).

## Installation
Currently, the only way to install is to clone this repository and pip install from the local directory:

```
git clone git@github.com:j6k4m8/pyrastitcher.git pyrastitcher
cd pyrastitcher
pip install -U .
```

Once there's more stuff going on, I'll put this on PyPI to make it pip-installable.
